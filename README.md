 # Spotify Clone

This is first ever swift project trying to follow MVVM architecture. It was a great learning process, and I came out of it much experienced.
Go ahead clone the repo, play around with the app.


## Set Up
- git clone https://github.com/mrSandeepKr/Spotify-Clone.git
- Move to root folder and `pod install`
- Create a spotify developers account and generate your client Id and password
- Move to `Spotify-Clone/SpoiftyClone/Managers/AuthManager.swift` and place them at line 145, 146 respectively.
- Open .xcworkspace and run the project
